            <h2> My name is John and living the simple life saved my life </h2>

            <p><b>I used to be a pack rat.</b> I had so many things
                that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was
                too much. Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I
                couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>

            <h3> How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><b>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got
                rid of everything.</b> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a
                smaller apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
                place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
            </p>
            <h3> 
            Now I live the simple life 
            </h3> 
            <p>Now that I'm living a
            simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more
            free time to enjoy. With how much it turned my life around, <b>I felt like I had no choice but to start
            sharing how I did it</b>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I
            started this site!
